# AlpineMapsOrg - Martin Setup

Simple utility project for [AlpineMapsOrg](https://github.com/AlpineMapsOrg/renderer)

This project contains some simple configurations for a [Martin](https://github.com/maplibre/martin) server. 
It also includes postgres queries that cluster POIs like peaks and cities and convert them into useable martin functions that return vector tiles.

start.sh starts a local leaflet application which provides a rudimentary vector tile output to get a feeling of the distribution and performance of the vector tile.
